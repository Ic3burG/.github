# 👋 Hi, I'm Omar Davis

**OJD Technical Solutions** · Toronto, Ontario, Canada

I build practical, well-engineered open-source tools — and offer
commercial licensing for teams and organizations that need it.

## 🚀 Projects

platform. Build, explore, and share interactive org charts with real-time

Intelligent receipt processing and organization — scan, categorize, and
manage receipts with AI-powered extraction.

([AGPL-3.0-or-later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)) for
